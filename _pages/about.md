Here I am - 50 years old taking the challenge of learning programming.

I spend a lot of time on the internet, with computers and I love to use efficient software like Linux, CLI, Bash, vim, markdown, md, pandoc, yaml.

I finished my programming somewhere around the 8-bit computer era. Now, I'm going to learn Python programming (in Pythonic way).

### More Information

I enjoy using simple, efficient, fast tools. I admire the way that kind of software fulfilling a need. The tools that are written by hackers.

You can feel the hacker's soul in some software. It's a way of thinking and it's a way of living. It is so close to the Zen of Python. It's hacking.
