Here I am - 50 years old taking a challenge of learning programming.

I spend a lot of time in the internet, with computers and I love to use efficient software like: Linux, CLI, Bash, vim, markdown, md, pandoc, yaml.

I finished my programming somewhere around 8-bit computer era. Now, I'm going to learn Python programming (in Pythonic way).

### More Information

I enjoy using simple, efficient, fast tools. I admire the way that kind of software fulfilling a need. The tools that are written by hackers.

You can feel hacker's soul in some software. It's way of thinking and it's way of living. It is so close to Zen of Python. It's hacking.
