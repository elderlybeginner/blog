People are buying Apple product for different reasons. Maybe you are one of them. Maybe you can explain it, maybe you can say a lot how great Apple products are, what the brand is for you. I am not a fan, so I won't understand it.

There is one thing I do understand. It is the way that Apple integrate its products. The harmony of devices and services make other companies product no fit. This harmony of devices is a gain for consumer.

I feel something similar in regards to Linux, bash, Vim, markdown, pandoc, CLI and GNU Software. There is beautiful **synergy** how this environment works. All these parts of broader system acknowledge the same values. It has something in common with Bazaar/OpenSource [wiki: The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar), modular build of software, pipes (|), standard input/output. It makes this software collaborative. The sum of usefulness of such software is not Big O (n), we are on Big O(n^2^) [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)
