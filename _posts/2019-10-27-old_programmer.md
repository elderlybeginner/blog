How about starting programming when you are half a century old?

Yes, I'm close to 50.  
Yes, I'm going to start programming.  
Yes, It's too late.  
Yes, It's a shame.  

I'm going to write about what I have learned each day.  
I'm going to write in on a daily basis.  
Hopefully, I will be learning something new every day.  
Stay tuned ;)
