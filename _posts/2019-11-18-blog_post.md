title: Write blog posts with two rules in your mind

Today I made an unwanted suggestion to somebody about how to write blog posts. Ignoring the facts that:

1. I am in position to give such advice  
2. Giving unwanted advice's is stupid and dangerous in general [^1]  
... I believe it was sensible what I said.

Write blog posts keeping in mind that:

1. You are writing to "future selves" (I took it from [Master Foo](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/unix-koans/prodigy.html)). In other words: let it be your note on subjects you will forget one day and you will be able to come back here.
2. You will use it when someone asks you about what cannot be explained in a few sentences. You will just redirect him to your post.

Easy said... and now I **only** have to follow my own advice.

Footnote:

[^1]:  
You think you can help somebody with your advice, you are giving it for free, you feel great. No one asked you about that, you bigwig little turd! Giving unwanted advice **may** only work in two situations:  
a) you've been given "license to kill" from that person,  
b) you are in such relation with that person that it is acceptable.  
**Don't give unwanted advice**
